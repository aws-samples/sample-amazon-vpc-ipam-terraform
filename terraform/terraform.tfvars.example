# Sample Terraform Implementation for Hierarchical IPAM on AWS
#
# This code demonstrates how to implement hierarchical IP Address Management
# across multiple AWS regions, business units, and environments.
#
# IMPORTANT: This code is provided as a sample for educational purposes.
# Before using in production, review security configurations and customize
# to meet your organizational requirements.
